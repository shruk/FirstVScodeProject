--java project structure.
main folder (root folder with app name e.g. my-app)
 -src (including java source and test source)
 -target (includes compiled .class files for JVM to run)
 .classpath file (xml file contains srouce and build path for folder structure)
 .project file (eclipse related file, should be in .gitignore)
 pom.xml file (maven file that control project management dependencies)

--run java
java is a java application lancher, a type of sdkTool.
javac abc.java file will generate .class file
java abc class file will run the simple class file

  -classpath is a path for java command to know where the .class file located
  e.g. java -classpath D:\myprogram org.mypackage.HelloWorld
  e.g. java -classpath "./simpleJavaProject" HelloWorld
  e.g. set CLASSPATH=D:\mygrogram
        java org.mypakcage.HelloWorld
  classpath checked under this sequence:1. -classpath 2. CLASSPATH environment variable 3. current directory
  classpath needs to also include any library path that program requires
    *java -classpath D:\myprogram;D:\myprogram\lib\supportLib.jar org.mypackage.HelloWorld
    OR
    *set CLASSPATH=D:\myprogram;D:\myprogram\lib\supportLib.jar
    java org.mypackage.HelloWorld

    *includ all .JAR in classpath
    java -classpath ".;c:\mylib\*" MyApp

*manifest file defines where the entry main class location is in a Jar file
    e.g.Main-Class: org.mypackage.HelloWorld
        Class-Path: lib/supportLib.jar

    to run such jar file
    java -jar D:\myprogram\helloWorld.jar

--creating jar for java file    
    1. create sample.java file and save 
    2. javac sample.java
    3. jar -cvf sample.jar sample.class   (create jar file)
    4. java -cp sample.jar sample (run the jar file, providing -cp for classpath)


--testing java
1. ensure Java test Runner is installed and enabled.
