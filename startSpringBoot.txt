After creating a maven application, Add annotation @SpringBootApplication in the class header where main function exists

@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that wraps commonly used annotations with spring boot.

@Configuration Spring configuration on startup, replace old xml configuration by using java
@EnableAutoConfiguration  Auto configures frameworks, auto-configure spring frameworks, dependencies
@ComponentScan Scan project for Spring components, it better place in the root level of application for directory scan.


Adding SpringApplication.run(App.class,args); inside main method

this method starts Spring, creates spring context, applies annotations and setsup container


Adding packages for controller/repository/service/model
in controller package, create HomeController and add @RestController
in controller method, add @RequestMapping to map request url.

in Spring boot, container is inside the application, so it is very portable.

1. plain java program.
2. spring context initialization.
3. embedded container and container less deployments.

spring mvc will provide restful endpoints.
