Overriding vs . Overloading
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.(compile-time concept)

Overriding means allow child class to provide a different imple to over write parent's impl. (runtime Polymorphism, run-time concept)


abstract class vs interface
interface there is no impl, can inheirt multiple interfaces.
doesn't have fields

abstract class is a class so it can only inherit only one abstract class,
can have fields
can have default imple
