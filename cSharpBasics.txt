Overriding vs . Overloading
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.(compile-time concept)

Overriding means allow child class to provide a different imple to over write parent's impl. (runtime Polymorphism, run-time concept)


abstract class vs interface
interface there is no impl, can inheirt multiple interfaces.
doesn't have fields

abstract class is a class so it can only inherit only one abstract class,
can have fields
can have default imple

== operator is defined as public static bool operator ==
so this is an class level operation and it will not work when inheritance come into play, basically it works as compile-time without inheritance.
static forces to use the overload on compile time.

.Equals(Object) is an instance operation and deals with dynamic type of objects.
This method is virtual
